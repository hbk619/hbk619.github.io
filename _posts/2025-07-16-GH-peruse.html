<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/gh-peruse">GH Peruse</a> is a Github CLI plugin/command line utility to
    read and interact with pull request comments one at a time.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
Inspired by a friends frustration at using the Github UI with Voiceover and the Github CLI only allowing you to view
    all comments at once, I created a plugin for the Github CLI to read comments one by one and allow replying to and
    resolving of threads.
</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<h3>Reading comments</h3>
<p>
    The default behaviour fetches the main body comments and threads and allows you to navigate backwards and forwards,
    outputting the file name, path and line number, along with the username and comment itself.
</p>

<h3>Replying and resolving</h3>

<p>
Using 'c' you can reply to a comment, and 'res' to  resolve a thread.
</p>

<h3>Copy</h3>

<p>
Sometimes a comment is really long and you want to read in a different editor, 'x' will copy the contents
    of the comment to your clipboard.
</p>

<h3>Resolved threads</h3>

<p>
    If the comment has already been resolved, 'This comment is resolved' will be output as generally there's no need
    to review it, but if you do want to 'e' will expand it and show you the contents.
</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<h3>Github CLI extension</h3>
<p>
    Install the <a href="https://cli.github.com/">Github CLI</a>. Then run <code>gh auth login</code> and authorise
    in the browser.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, run <code>gh extension install https://github.com/hbk619/gh-peruse</code>. Now the
    <code>gh peruse pr</code> command is available! Add -h for more info.
</p>
<h3>Without Github CLI</h3>
<p>
    If you don't want/can't use the Github CLI that's ok. You can
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/gh-peruse?tab=readme-ov-file#without-installing-github-cli">install without the Github CLI</a>.
    This is a little more involved as you need to create tokens but when setup you'll be able to run <code>git peruse pr</code>.

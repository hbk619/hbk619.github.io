<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/intellisay">IntelliSay</a> is a plugin for Intellij which adds sounds and speech
    for various things.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
IntelliJ is a really awesome tool to use when writing code, and has a ton of useful features from easily debugging apps
to fantastic auto complete, but I'd heard screen reader devs had been warned against using it. Jetbrain's Youtrack has
an open bug with <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-58367/Various-accessibility-issues-as-of-2023.3">
    a pretty detailed list of various issues a screen reader user ran into</a>, it's a long list!
</p>

<p>
    Tackling all of the issues is a huge undertaking and while Jetbrains gets to work on that, I wanted to tackle some
    of the core features that other IDE's have.
</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<h3>Sounds</h3>
<p>
    A fairly standard feature in other IDE's is to play a short sound when navigating to a line that contains an error
    or breakpoint. IntelliSay implements this, with a warning noise to indicate there's a problem and an error noise to
    indicate you're on the error. A bonus feature is a shortcut to guide you towards the error and then read out the error
    message. "Not on issue, go right, or press F2." or "Not on issue, go left.".
</p>

<p>
    Breakpoints make sounds too, when adding/removing or navigating to a line with one. Because of the latter, when you
    debug an app and it pauses on a breakpoint, the "you're on a breakpoint" noise will be triggered.
</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>
There's a detailed panel for evaluating code when paused on a breakpoint, but it's difficult to get to and you lose
    context of where you are in the code. With IntelliSay, just select some text and press the shortcut
    <code>control meta alt v</code> and the selected code will be evaluated and the result spoken, with the type and
    value. This works with any text you select and will be evaluated in the context of your current project.
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>
    Intellij's pinning of method/class names to the top of the screen is great to know where you are at a glance, but
I couldn't get a screen reader to read it easily, without losing the current place. So IntelliSay has a shortcut
to read the current context, "Inside method main arguments are args JavaLang string return type is void class in main"
    without moving your screen reader cursor.
</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

Quickly find out what file you're in with a shortcut, or have it automatically announced when opened from the project
view.

<h3>Dumb mode</h3>

<p>
    Intellij has a state called dumb mode which means not all features of the IDE are available yet as it still scanning
    your project and configuring things in the background, visually there's an indicator in the bottom right of the
    window that this is happening and code often won't have syntax highlighting. IntelliSay is hooked into this state
    and can announce when dumb mode is entered and exited, so you know to wait patiently while it does its thing.
</p>

<h3>Python Interpreters</h3>

<p>
    If you're using the python plugin, instead of trying to navigate the many dialogues to setting a python interpreter
    there's a shortcut to bring up a simple text input where you can type the path to your interpreter and press enter,
    then IntelliJ will setup the project with your interpreter.
</p>

<h3>Help!</h3>
<p>
That's a lot of shortcuts to remember! That's why there's a help dialogue with the default keyboard shortcut of
<code>control alt meta shift h</code>. This brings up a dialogue that lists all the commands and their associated
shortcut. If you select an item and press enter it will do the action, escape closes the dialogue.
</p>

<h3>Configuring and customising</h3>
<p>
    As everyone's experience is personal, so too can IntelliSay be personalised. The settings dialog allows you to
    supply a path to custom sounds, check the
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/intellisay?tab=readme-ov-file#customising-sounds">project readme for custom sound file names</a>.
    IntelliJ lets you change any shortcut too, via File > Settings > Keymap > search for intellisay.
    Beeps can be enabled or disabled via shortcuts, a quick action (press shift twice, then search for what you want to
    do) or the settings dialogue (File > Settings > Tools > IntelliSay).
</p>

<h4>MacOS</h4>
<p>
    On Macos, if you have "Allow voiceover to be controlled by AppleScript" enabled, Intellisay will use VoiceOver,
    if not it will use the say command. If you want to force it to use the say command there's a setting for that.
</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>
    Download the intellisay-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip file from the
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/intellisay/releases/">IntelliSay releases</a> page. In IntelliJ
    press shift twice to bring up the quick actions menu and select "Install plugin from Disk".
    Select the downloaded zip and restart IntelliJ. You should hear "IntelliSay has started", if not check the
    <a href="https://github.com/hbk619/intellisay?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide</a>.
